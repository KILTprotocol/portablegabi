Data sovereignty and interoperability

# Mash-Net SDK

The open-source KILT SDK is written in TypeScript and enables you to quickly and easily build dApps around new business use cases. KILT is a protocol for self-sovereign data and interoperability built on top of the permissionless KILT blockchain. The SDK provides collection of classes and methods you can utilize to interact with the KILT Protocol.

- **Self-sovereign data.** Have ownership of your digital and analog identities, with control over who your users share that data with. Providing that extra layer of flexiblity and security.

- **Interoperability.** Claim Types (CTYPEs) facilitate the adoption of standardised credential content structures.

To learn more, checkout the KILT [Whitepaper](https://kilt.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/KILT-Whitepaper-v2019-May-28.pdf) or see our [how it works](https://kilt.io/kilt-data-sovereignty-and-interoperability/) video.

## How to install the SDK

Install the KILT-SDK by running the following commands:

```bash

    npm install @kiltprotocol/sdk-js

```

Or with `yarn`:

```bash

    yarn add @kiltprotocol/sdk-js

```

## Example

More examples can be found within our [getting started guide](https://github.com/KILTprotocol/sdk-js/blob/develop/docs/getting-started.md).

A claim type (CTYPE) can be credentials, of any kind, e.g. drivers license.

Building a claim must be done by the defined CTYPE respective fields.

Now we can easily create the KILT compliant claim. We have to include the full CType object, the raw claim object and the address of the owner/creator of the claim in the constructor:

```TypeScript


    const rawClaim = {
     name: 'Alice',
     age: 29,
     }

     const claim = new Kilt.Claim(ctype, rawClaim, claimer)

    Claim {
    cType:
     '0x5a9d939af9fb5423e3e283f16996438da635de8dc152b13d3a67f01e3d6b0fc0',
    contents: { name: 'Alice', age: 29 },
    owner: '5EvSHoZF23mZS4XKQBLdqMv7a7CRSANJmxn7XDu6hwoiK4Wz' }


```
