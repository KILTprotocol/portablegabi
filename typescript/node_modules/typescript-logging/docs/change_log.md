* 0.4.1
  * [Issue 19](https://github.com/mreuvers/typescript-logging/issues/19) has been fixed (log.debug text not displayed in node 8 console).
  * [Issue 21](https://github.com/mreuvers/typescript-logging/issues/21) has been fixed (CategoryServiceFactory.setConfigurationCategory if category is a child must not attempt to reset root logger).
  * ** Distribution package is broken, please do not use. **
* 0.4.0
  * Added new feature to to both log4j and category style, to specify a formatterLogMessage function instead of custom logger, which allows you to override the formatting of the log message without having to create a custom logger. Please see the docs for more details.
  * **Potentially breaking change** Both Logger and CategoryLogger message (LogMessage and CategoryLogMessage) now allow to log their message as: string | LogData (this was only string), LogData is an interface which allows you to also set a message (msg) and additional data if needed. Please see the docs for more details. Potentially breaks custom loggers, instead use properties and one of these to help you out: messageAsString, isMessageLogData and logData properties.
    * Thanks for the pull request @CSchulz !
    * See also [issue 14](https://github.com/mreuvers/typescript-logging/issues/14)
  * **Potentially breaking change** Changed CategoryLogMessage and LogMessage, now both have readonly properties only for their data, instead of methods to get the information. If you use a custom logger this may break for you, to fix just use the properties data instead.
    * See also [issue 9](https://github.com/mreuvers/typescript-logging/issues/9)
  * CategoryServiceFactory
    * Method setDefaultConfiguration, default reset parameter changed to true (from false). Reset of everything is now done by default.
    * Method setConfigurationCategory, default reset parameter changed to true (from false). Resets root logger now.

* 0.3.0 (current release)
